# WeaverUnlimited
Recreation of popular of Wordle-type game "Weaver"

Project Description:

Weaver is a puzzle game where you are given a four-letter word to start and end with. The original version of the game can be played at https://wordwormdormdork.com. The objective of the game is to change one letter at a time (while maintaining a valid* word) to get to the desired word. For example, the start word is "food" and the end word is "cold". You could first change the second ‘o’ to an ‘l’ with the word “fold”. From there, you could change the letter ‘f’ to ‘c’ to get the desired word “cold”. The problem with the current version of weaver is that it is formatted so that the user can only play once a day. In this version of weaver, the user will be able to play as many times as desired. This version will keep track of many statistics of the gameplay, such as average time to complete a puzzle, average amount of words required, and the amount of puzzles solved. The project will also be able to display the optimal solution to the puzzle upon the user’s completion. 

*valid words are determined by bestwordlist.com and can be found at https://www.bestwordlist.com/4letterwords.htm
